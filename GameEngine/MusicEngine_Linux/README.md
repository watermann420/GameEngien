# MusicEngine Linux Stub

Original MusicEngine sources are not present in this workspace. This stub exists to keep project parity and can be replaced with the real code.

To port the real MusicEngine:
1. Drop the actual sources into `src/`.
2. Replace `main.cpp` with the real entry point.
3. Add any dependencies to `CMakeLists.txt`.
