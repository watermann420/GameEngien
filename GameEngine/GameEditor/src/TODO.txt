Planned implementation notes:
- Choose UI tech: WinUI 3 (C#) or ImGui (C++) with docking.
- File browser: root at ../EngineFiles; watch filesystem for changes (FileSystemWatcher).
- Asset preview: ImGui + stb_image for textures; basic FBX metadata via Assimp.
- Scene format: JSON (entities, components, references to EngineFiles paths).
- Integrate Play button: build/run GameEngine with selected scene passed via CLI.
